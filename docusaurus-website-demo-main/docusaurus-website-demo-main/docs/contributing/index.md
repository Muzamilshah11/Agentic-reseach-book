## Documentation Standards

### Content Quality
All contributions must meet our constitutional principles:

- **Accuracy**: All content must be research-based and cite sources where possible
- **Academic Language**: Use professional academic language suitable for thesis/research papers
- **Structure**: Follow the 8-chapter book-style structure
- **Visual Aids**: Include diagrams (Mermaid for architecture), code snippets, and practical examples
- **Agentic Focus**: Prioritize agentic AI concepts: planning, tools, multi-agent, constitution-driven development
- **Safety & Ethics**: Avoid hallucinations, provide transparent reasoning
- **Format Compatibility**: Use Markdown compatible with Docusaurus (MDX if needed)
- **Modularity**: Keep docs modular, versionable, and easy to extend

### Writing Style
- Use clear, professional language
- Define technical terms when first introduced
- Provide context for complex concepts
- Structure content logically with appropriate headings
- Use examples to illustrate concepts

### Code Examples
When adding code examples:
- Ensure all code is executable and tested
- Use appropriate syntax highlighting
- Explain the purpose and functionality of the code
- Follow TypeScript/JavaScript best practices

### Diagrams
When adding diagrams:
- Use Mermaid syntax for consistency
- Ensure diagrams clearly illustrate concepts
- Provide alt text descriptions
- Place diagrams near relevant content

## Content Structure

### Chapter Organization
Each chapter should include:
- Clear introduction to the topic
- Detailed explanations with examples
- Practical applications
- Cross-references to related sections
- Summary of key points

### Cross-References
Link to related sections within the documentation:
- Link to foundational concepts when introducing new topics
- Reference advanced topics when appropriate
- Use relative links to other documentation pages

## Technical Requirements

### File Structure
- Place content in the appropriate chapter directory
- Use descriptive filenames
- Follow the existing file naming conventions

### Metadata
Include appropriate frontmatter in Markdown files:
```markdown
