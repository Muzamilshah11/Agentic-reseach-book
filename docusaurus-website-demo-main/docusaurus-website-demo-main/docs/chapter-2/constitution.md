# Constitution Framework

This section details the constitutional framework that guides the development and implementation of agentic AI systems in our research project.

## Core Principles

Our agentic AI systems development is guided by eight core constitutional principles:

### I. Content Accuracy & Research-Based Approach
All implementations must be accurate, research-based, and cite sources where possible (2025-2026 trends). Documentation and code must adhere to academic standards with verifiable claims.

### II. Academic Language & Professional Communication
Use clear, professional academic language suitable for thesis/research papers. Writing must maintain scholarly tone appropriate for technical audience.

### III. Structured Documentation Format
Structure everything in chapters/sections (8-10 chapter book style). Each major topic should be organized as a dedicated chapter with numbered subsections.

### IV. Visual Aids & Practical Examples
Include diagrams (Mermaid for architecture), code snippets, and practical examples. All diagrams must be created using Mermaid for consistency and maintainability.

### V. Agentic AI Concepts Focus
Prioritize agentic AI concepts: planning, tools, multi-agent, constitution-driven development. Planning systems must be thoroughly documented with examples of goal decomposition and task scheduling.

### VI. Safety & Ethics Standards
Safety & Ethics: Avoid hallucinations, no harmful suggestions, transparent reasoning. All implementations must be factually accurate without fabricating information.

### VII. Output Format Compatibility
Output format: Markdown compatible with Docusaurus (MDX if needed). All documentation must be authored in Markdown format for compatibility with Docusaurus static site generator.

### VIII. Modular & Extensible Documentation
Keep docs modular, versionable, and easy to extend. Each section should be self-contained while maintaining connection to broader documentation.

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Standards
- All code must follow TypeScript best practices
- Proper error handling and validation
- Comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Clear documentation for all public interfaces

### Architecture Principles
- Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- Configuration over convention where appropriate
- Observability and monitoring built-in
- Scalable and performant by design

## Compliance Verification

All contributions to the agentic AI systems research project must undergo constitutional compliance verification:

1. **Content Review**: Verify adherence to academic standards and research-based approach
2. **Code Review**: Ensure implementation follows architectural principles
3. **Testing Verification**: Confirm adequate test coverage
4. **Documentation Check**: Validate proper documentation and examples

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices. All code reviews must verify compliance with these principles. Amendments require formal documentation and team approval with migration plan if needed.

## Next Steps

After understanding the constitutional framework, proceed to Chapter 3: Specification to learn about our methodologies for defining agentic AI systems.
