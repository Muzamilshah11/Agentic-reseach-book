# Welcome to the Agentic AI Research Project

We're excited to announce the launch of our comprehensive documentation site for agentic AI systems research. This site serves as a central hub for understanding, developing, and implementing agentic AI systems based on cutting-edge research and best practices.

## What is Agentic AI?

Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that exhibit goal-directed behavior, making autonomous decisions to achieve specific objectives. These systems are characterized by their ability to:

- Plan and execute complex sequences of actions
- Use tools and interact with external systems
- Learn from experience and adapt their behavior
- Operate with minimal human intervention

## Our Research Focus

Our research encompasses several key areas of agentic AI:

- **Planning and Reasoning**: How agents formulate and execute plans to achieve goals
- **Tool Usage**: How agents effectively utilize external tools and resources
- **Multi-Agent Systems**: How multiple agents coordinate and collaborate
- **Safety and Alignment**: Ensuring agents behave in accordance with human values
- **Learning and Adaptation**: How agents improve their performance over time

## Documentation Structure

Our documentation is organized as an 8-chapter book-style guide:

1. **Setup**: Getting started with agentic AI development
2. **Constitution**: Framework and principles for development
3. **Specification**: Methodologies for defining agentic systems
4. **Planning**: Approaches to goal decomposition and task scheduling
5. **Implementation**: Patterns and best practices for building agentic systems
6. **Advanced Agentic Patterns**: Complex multi-agent and coordination patterns
7. **Evaluation**: Metrics and methodologies for assessing agentic systems
8. **Future Work**: Emerging trends and research directions

## Research-Based Approach

All content in this documentation is grounded in current research (2025-2026 trends) and follows academic standards for accuracy and verifiability. We cite relevant papers and studies to support our claims and recommendations.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the research community. Please see our contribution guidelines in the documentation section for details on how to contribute to this project.
